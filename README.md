# py-dropin-session
Some teaching notebooks for Python Drop-in session (based on Carpentry lessons)   

* __carp_python.ipynb__ is a condensation of the Carpentries lesson.
* __pydropin-exercise.ipynb__ is a similar exercise to the final one in the Carpentries lesson except that the students are led through an exploration of the pima Indians dataset. This may be helpful if they have had difficulties with the Carpentries example.
